# Exploration of Binding Curves

In an effort to better explaing the consideration of binding curves more, I've created an `R Shiny` interactive webapp.
Hopefully this will easily show why not considering concentrations and the kd of your interactions can lead to false Kd measurements.

Play around with the app hosted on R shin below, or poke around in the R code yourself.
